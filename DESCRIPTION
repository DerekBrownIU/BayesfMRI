Description: Performs a spatial Bayesian general linear model (GLM) for task 
    fMRI data on the cortical surface. The INLA package is required, which, due
    to a CRAN policy, will not be installed automatically. You can obtain INLA 
    by running `install.packages("INLA", repos=c(getOption("repos"), 
    INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)`.
