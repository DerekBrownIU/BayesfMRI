Description: The main function is BayesGLM, which performs a spatial Bayesian general linear model (GLM) for task fMRI data on the cortical surface. The INLA package is required, which, due to a CRAN policy, will not be installed automatically. You can obtain the two packages by running `install.packages("INLA", repos=c(getOption("repos"), INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)`.
