Description: The two main functions are BayesGLM and templateICA.  BayesGLM performs a spatial Bayesian general linear model (GLM) for task fMRI data on the cortical surface.  The templateICA function performs template ICA and spatial template ICA for subject-level brain network estimation. The INLA package is required, which, due to a CRAN policy, will not be installed automatically. You can obtain the two packages by running `install.packages("INLA", repos=c(getOption("repos"), INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)`.
