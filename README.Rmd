`BayesfMRI` R package. Includes the main function `BayesGLM`, which implements the spatial Bayesian GLM for task fMRI on the cortical surface proposed by Mejia et al. 2019a [https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2019.1611582].  Also contains two wrapper functions:

* `BayesGLM_cifti` â€“ implements `BayesGLM` on CIFTI-format (greyordinates) fMRI data
* `BayesGLM_slice` - implements `BayesGLM` on slice-wise volumetric fMRI data

## Citation

If you use `BayesfMRI`, please cite our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2019.1611582 ). You can also obtain citation information from within R like so:

``` {r}
citation("BayesfMRI")
```

## Important Note on Dependencies:

`BayesfMRI` depends on the `ciftiTools` package, which requires an installation of Connectome Workbench.  It can be installed from the [HCP website](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench).

<!-- The INLA package is required, which, due to a CRAN policy, will not be installed automatically. You can obtain it by running `install.packages("INLA", repos=c(getOption("repos"), INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=FALSE)`.  The default R-INLA binaries are built on Ubuntu1604. Instructions on how to obtain binaries for other Linux builds are available at https://www.r-inla.org/events/alternativelinuxbuilds.  **Note: INLA must be installed before installing `BayesfMRI`.**

An INLA-PARDISO license is also required for computational efficiency.  To obtain an INLA-PARDISO license, run `inla.pardiso()` in R after running `library(INLA)`. Once you obtain a license, point to it using `INLA::inla.setOption(pardiso.license = "pardiso.lic")` followed by `INLA::inla.pardiso.check()` to ensure that PARDISO is successfully installed and running. -->
